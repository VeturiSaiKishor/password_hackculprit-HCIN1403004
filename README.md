1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the design, development, and implementation of the project titled "password strength analyser", undertaken as part of the Hack Culprit Virtual Internship. The objective was to build a practical, technically sound solution using modern tools and frameworks. The project enhances key skills such as problem-solving, collaboration through GitHub, and real-world application of theoretical knowledge.

2. Problem Statement
In the digital age, weak passwords remain a leading cause of security breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Despite increased awareness, many users continue to choose passwords that are short, predictable, or reused across multiple platforms. This significantly increases the risk of brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.

The objective of this project is to develop a Password Strength Analyzer that evaluates the robustness of user-provided passwords in real time. The tool will analyze key parameters such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and entropy. Based on these metrics, it will classify the password into categories like weak, moderate, or strong, and provide actionable feedback to help users create more secure passwords.

This project aims to enhance password hygiene among users and support cybersecurity awareness by promoting the use of strong and unique passwords.
